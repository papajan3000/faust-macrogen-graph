    "In this notebook we take a detailed look at the macrogenesis of the <b>Faust</b> edition. As explained in the Readme (see: <i>Readme.md</i>), the manuscripts hold the problem that a ordering of all these manuscript by dates isn't possible. One of the reasons are the contradictory datings. These are due to the fact that the inclusion of the various research opinions induces different datings. The goal of the macrogenesis is to create an order with a <b>graph</b> as structure.<br> A graph can be sorted topologically and thus realize the goal of the ordered macrogenesis. To create a topological order the graph has to be acyclic. Due to the contradictions, however, it is not acyclic. To obtain an acyclic graph, edges must be removed. The removed set of edges to make a graph acyclic is called <b>FAS</b> (= Feedback Arc Set or Feedback Edge Set). The algorithm we will use to compute a minimal FAS (MFAS) is by Peter <b>Eades</b> because it is simple, effective and doesn't need a lot of computing power.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "AUS 4.1:\n",
    "A characteristic of the FAS generated in section 3.2 is the randomness of the removed edges. The MFAS algorithm by <b>Eades</b> tries to find a minimal solution for the acyclic graph problem. The edges are added to the FAS according to the criterion of their indegree, outdegree and feature as feedback and the edge attributes such as the <i>source</i> are disregarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will rely on the following three main questions:\n",
    "1. How can we integrate the absolute datings? How does the FAS look like with and without absolute datings?\n",
    "2. Can a more detailed analysis of the number of edges and the number of contradictions be helpful to decide which edges of which source should be removed?\n",
    "3. Can erroneously removed edges be re-added without sacrificing performance? How can this be done and how many edges can be re-added?\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: explaination of steps (first some parameters, which will be tested later more detailed)<br>\n",
    "Now follows a short overview of the sections:<br>\n",
    "<b>Section 2 &amp; 3</b>: In this sections we generate the graph out of three different graphs. In section 3.1 we generate graphs based on the @temppre- and @tempsyn-relation-elements. In section 3.2 we combine the relation graphs with a generated graph based on the date-elements. Unlike the relation graphs, there are several variants of the date-graph, which is due to the different approaches how to implement the absolute dates. We partly answer the first main question how the integration of the absolute datings look like by comparing the different approaches and choosing the best performing approach for the integration into the graph(?). A deeper and more detailed comparison of the approaches will appear in <b>section TODO </b>(?).<br>\n",
    "<b>Section 4</b>: partly answer of question 2, more in chapter TODO<br>\n",
    "<b>Section 5</b>: <br>\n",
    "<b>Section 6</b>: Comparison of the Vitt graph and two variants of the Vitt graph with changed periods. \n",
    "For all three approaches, an attempt is now made to answer each of the three main questions. The ideas and functions of the previous sections are used and applied to the cyclic or acyclic graph of the respective approach. There are three steps to each approach:\n",
    "1. Minimizing the removal of sources within the FAS\n",
    "2. Deleting whole sources\n",
    "3. Checking by weigths<br>\n",

The approaches <b>Paulus-1</b> and <b>Paulus-2</b> are made by the author of this notebook and they are for illustrative purposes only.  The basic idea was that that either the \"notBefore\"-elements or the \"notAfter\"-elements should be linked to the respective manuscript but not both like the <b>Vitt</b>-approach. Although this did not induce a FAS, the number of nodes and edges was much smaller than the <b>Vitt</b>-approach.

    "A characteristic of the FAS generated in section 3.2 is the randomness of the removed edges. The MFAS algorithm by <b>Eades</b> tries to find a minimal solution for the acyclic graph problem. The edges are added to the FAS according to the criterion of their indegree, outdegree and feature as feedback and the edge attributes such as the <i>source</i> are disregarded. However, we want both an acyclic graph and a minimum of removed sources which in our case has a higher priority than a MFAS. In this section we take a look at the source attributes of the edges. In the XML files, a dating is attested by a source. The problem is that these sources contradict each other which is certainly the reason for the existence of the FAS. To make the graph acyclic, we have to get rid of these contradictory statements.<br>\n",
    "We parse through the \"source\"-attributes of the edges of the graph and return a Counter with a frequency score assigned to each researcher. The idea behind this is that a researcher who contributed more than others will get a much higher score. The problem is that by this method quantity surpasses quality. It is not that simple to compare two academic works by its quality and the resulting benefit for the research because the comparison possibilities are manifold and a detailed comparison would exceed this work. As simplification we adjust the scores by multiplying each score with a normalized year of the publication of the researchers work about <b>Faust</b>.\n",

    "After the normalization of the source counts we have to take a deeper look at the <b>Feedback Arc Set</b>. The FAS contains 130 edges. More than a third of the FAS is taken up by \"wa_I_15_2\" and more than twice as much as the second, third and fourth most common sources by \"fischer-lamberg1955\", \"bohnenkamp1994\" and \"landeck1981\" (see the FAS-frequency DataFrame <i>fasfrequency_df</i>).<br> In this section we try to bypass the computed FAS by trying to make the graph <b>G</b> acylic with the removal of specific sources. We rely on the normed research score of the previous section (see 4.1). The idea behind this is that the FAS has a certain randomness because it tries to compute a minimal solution for the problem (at least if we use the <b>Eades</b> or any other MFAS algorithm). This holds the problem that the removal of the edges to make the graph <b>G</b> acyclic and its randomness makes little sense with regards of content. Against the background of an ideal solution which returns a perfect sorting, the goal is rather to find critical, conflicting sources. Nevertheless, we use the FAS to filter for critical sources and take a closer look a the sources who have the most edges within the FAS.\n",

    "So we have shown that using the <b>Vitt</b> approach has advantages over the other approaches in Section 3.2 and in this section we proved that the Vitt-approach is the most useful approach for solving our issues. This is not particularly surprising for the Paulus-approaches, as the conjunction of the both apporaches is basically the Vitt approach. The problem with the Wissenbach approach seems to be that it, like the Paulus-approaches, connects only one node that represents the middle of the \"notBefore\" and \"notAfter\" dates to the manuscript. So it seems that the <b>basic structure</b> of the Vitt approach of representing \"notBefore\" and \"notAfter\" as their own nodes and linking them to the manuscript is the most practical solution. In the following we will manipulate the \"notBefore\" and the \"notAfter\" dates in the Vitt approach and see how these changes affect the nodes, edges, cycles and the FAS."

    "In this section we manipulate the \"notBefore\" and \"notAfter\" datings and compare them with the original datings. The idea of the manipulation is that the \"notBefore\" and \"notAfter\" dates were determined by researchers and some assessments do not suit with the assessments of other researchers, which ultimately leads to an acyclic graph and the existence of a FAS. But before we remove the \"most critical\" sources (see section 4.2), let's see if we can gain new insights into the problem sources first by adding or removing days from the \"notBefore\" and \"notAfter\" elements. However, the ratio should remain the same for the increment of days and the period between days, so the same number of days are always taken or added from the \"notBefore\" and \"notAfter\" dates.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Several factors should be considered when comparing these approaches with the Vitt approach:\n",
    "- Number of nodes: A higher number of nodes is not an indication of a suitable approach by itself, but in the case of a \"tie\", the approach which has more nodes should be taken\n",
    "- FAS size: The smaller the FAS is the better.\n",
    "- Cycles: The less the better. A small number of cycles becomes interesting, especially for the question of how to get the graph cycle-free without the calculation of a FAS (see Section 4.2)."

An ideal solution would only remove some edges from one source. These could then be implemented relatively easily in the <b>Faust</b>-Edition and treated as \"invalid or incorrect statements\". Since it is already clear from the outset that we will not be able to do this, in this section we try to find the best sequence of sources to be removed so that the graph becomes cycle-free. Only the order in which most sources can still stay in the graph is examined. Using this order, the edges of the sources, which are not likely to generate a new FAS, are then gradually added back to the acyclic graph <b> alG </b>. On the other hand, the experiment is then confronted with a random, not source-oriented, new acquisition of edges, and both experiments are then compared."

    "As a conclusion from this section, we can say that deleting by sources is not as effective as deleting problematic edges, but would make more sense in terms of content. Unfortunately, we were unable to bypass the problem sources \"fischer-lamberg1955\" and \"wa_I_15_2\" because they cover a large proportion of the graph nodes (the have the lowest \"fas_without_source\"-values within the <b>norm_df</b>). But we were able to exclude the sources \"bohnenkamp1994\" and except for two edges \"landeck1981\" and one edge of \"faust://self\", which are the other three major research sources, from the FAS. If we look at the <b>norm_df</b>, we see that \"bohnenkamp1994\" holds the first place at the <i>norm_year_frequency</i>-score and \"faust://self\" and \"landeck1981\" the fourth and fifth place. All three source together have an approximately equal <i>norm_percent_fas</i>-score like \"fischer-lamberg1955\" (5.958762999999999 (0.981613 + 1.534161 + 3.442989) ≈ 5.804935) and only about a quarter of the <i>norm_percent_fas</i>-score of \"wa_I_15_2\".\n",

Edges with the weight \"5.0\" are edges that represent a @tempsyn-relation-element. The @tempsyn-relation-elements state that two manuscripts were written at about the same time. One way to represent them in the graph would be to insert two parallel edges (TODO already in introduction or so). Due to complexity reasons, however, it was implemented like the @temppre-relation elements, but with a different weight. These would also have a higher priority over the edges with a \"1.0\" weight, which would get all edges that do not represent a @when-attribute of a date element or @tempsyn-relation-element. In the case of lG, however, none of these edges are in the FAS."

Im Gegensatz zum longer-period-graph sind nach einer Entfernung der beiden Quellen noch 7 der 9 übriggebliebenen Quellen des originalen FAS im neuen FAS. Nur die Quellen \"inventare_2_2\" und \"hertz1931\" konnten nach der Entfernung von \"fischer-lamberg1955\" und \"wa_I_15_2\" erfolgreich aus dem FAS entfernt werden. Diese Quellen hatten jedoch nur einen kleinen Anteil am FAS und am gesamten Graphen. Zudem haben sie einen eher niedrigen \"norm_year_frequency\"-score, weshalb sie eigentlich eher entfernt werden sollten als andere (AF!!!). "

    "As a conclusion from this section, we can say that deleting by sources is not as effective as deleting problematic edges, but would make more sense in terms of content. Unfortunately, we were unable to bypass the problem sources \"fischer-lamberg1955\" and \"wa_I_15_2\" because they cover a large proportion of the graph nodes (the have the lowest \"fas_without_source\"-values within the <b>norm_df</b>). But we were able to exclude the sources \"bohnenkamp1994\" and except for two edges \"landeck1981\" and one edge of \"faust://self\", which are the other three major research sources, from the FAS. If we look at the <b>norm_df</b>, we see that \"bohnenkamp1994\" holds the first place at the <i>norm_year_frequency</i>-score and \"faust://self\" and \"landeck1981\" the fourth and fifth place. All three source together have an approximately equal <i>norm_percent_fas</i>-score like \"fischer-lamberg1955\" (5.958762999999999 (0.981613 + 1.534161 + 3.442989) ≈ 5.804935) and only about a quarter of the <i>norm_percent_fas</i>-score of \"wa_I_15_2\".\n",
