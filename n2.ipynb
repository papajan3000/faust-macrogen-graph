    "In this notebook we take a detailed look at the macrogenesis of the <b>Faust</b> edition. As explained in the Readme (see: <i>Readme.md</i>), the manuscripts hold the problem that a ordering of all these manuscript by dates isn't possible. One of the reasons are the contradictory datings. These are due to the fact that the inclusion of the various research opinions induces different datings. The goal of the macrogenesis is to create an order with a <b>graph</b> as structure.<br> A graph can be sorted topologically and thus realize the goal of the ordered macrogenesis. To create a topological order the graph has to be acyclic. Due to the contradictions, however, it is not acyclic. To obtain an acyclic graph, edges must be removed. The removed set of edges to make a graph acyclic is called <b>FAS</b> (= Feedback Arc Set or Feedback Edge Set). The algorithm we will use to compute a minimal FAS (MFAS) is by Peter <b>Eades</b> because it is simple, effective and doesn't need a lot of computing power.<br><br>\n",
    "In this notebook we will rely on the following three main questions:\n",
    "1. How can we integrate the absolute datings? How does the FAS look like with and without absolute datings?\n",
    "2. Can a more detailed analysis of the number of edges and the number of contradictions be helpful to decide which edges of which source should be removed?\n",
    "3. Can erroneously removed edges be re-added without sacrificing performance? How can this be done and how many edges can be re-added?\n",

    "Now follows a short overview of the sections:<br>\n",
    "<b>Section 2 &amp; 3</b>: In this sections we generate the graph out of three different graphs. In section 3.1 we generate graphs based on the @temppre- and @tempsyn-relation-elements. In section 3.2 we combine the relation graphs with a generated graph based on the date-elements. Unlike the relation graphs, there are several variants of the date-graph, which is due to the different approaches how to implement the absolute dates. We partly answer the first main question how the integration of the absolute datings look like by comparing the different approaches and choosing the best performing approach for the integration into the graph(?). A deeper and more detailed comparison of the approaches will appear in <b>section TODO </b>(?).<br>\n",

    "After the normalization of the source counts we have to take a deeper look at the <b>Feedback Arc Set</b>. The FAS contains 130 edges. More than a third of the FAS is taken up by \"wa_I_15_2\" and more than twice as much as the second, third and fourth most common sources by \"fischer-lamberg1955\", \"bohnenkamp1994\" and \"landeck1981\" (see the FAS-frequency DataFrame <i>fasfrequency_df</i>).<br> In this section we try to bypass the computed FAS by trying to make the graph <b>G</b> acylic with the removal of specific sources. We rely on the normed research score of the previous section (see 4.1). The idea behind this is that the FAS has a certain randomness because it tries to compute a minimal solution for the problem (at least if we use the <b>Eades</b> or any other MFAS algorithm). This holds the problem that the removal of the edges to make the graph <b>G</b> acyclic and its randomness makes little sense with regards of content. Against the background of an ideal solution which returns a perfect sorting, the goal is rather to find critical, conflicting sources. Nevertheless, we use the FAS to filter for critical sources and take a closer look a the sources who have the most edges within the FAS.\n",

    "So we have shown that taking the <b>Vitt</b> approach has advantages over the other approaches in Section 3 and in this section we proved that the Vitt-approach is the most useful approach for solving our issues. This is not particularly surprising for the Paulus-approaches, as these are basically the Vitt approach when they are jointed (???). The problem with the Wissenbach approach seems to be that, like the Paulus-approaches, it connects only one node that represents the middle of the \"notBefore\" and \"notAfter\" dates to the manuscript. So it seems that the <b>basic structure</b> of the Vitt approach of representing \"notBefore\" and \"notAfter\" as their own nodes and linking them to the manuscript is the most practical solution. In the following we will manipulate the \"notBefore\" and the \"notAfter\" dates in the Vitt approach and see how these changes affect the nodes, edges, cycles and the FAS.\n",

    "In this section we manipulate the \"notBefore\" and \"notAfter\" datings and compare it with the original datings. The idea of the manipulation is that the \"notBefore\" and \"notAfter\" dates were determined by researchers and some assessments do not agree with the assessments of other researchers, which ultimately leads to an acyclic graph and the existence of a FAS. But before we remove the \"most critical\" sources (see section ? TODO), let's first see if we can gain new insights into the problem sources by adding or removing days from the \"notBefore\" and \"notAfter\" elements. However, the ratio should remain the same for the distance and increase, so the same number of days are always taken or added from the \"notBefore\" and \"notAfter\" dates.<br>\n",

    "- FAS size: The smaller the FAS is the better.\n",

Furthermore, it has more nodes than the Vitt approach. That's because there are many more different datings which resulted from the addition and subtraction of days. Therefore the <b>comparison_nodelist</b> contains only datings.<br>\n",

    "Hier werden immer einzelne Kanten von kritischen Quellen entfernt um das FAS zu verkleinern. Dabei sollen so wenig wie möglich Quellen verwendet werden und von diesen so wenig wie möglich Kanten. Bei der Ideallösung würden nur von einer Quelle einige Kanten entfernt werden. Diese könnten man dann relativ einfach in der Faustedition umsetzen und als \"ungültige bzw. fehlerhafte Aussagen\" behandeln. Da von vorneherein eigentlich schon klar ist, dass wir das nicht schaffen werden, versuchen wir in dieser Sektion, die beste Reihenfolge von Quellen zu finden, die man entfernen muss, damit der Graph zyklenfrei wird. Es wird dann nur die Reihenfolge untersucht, bei der die meisten Quellen noch in dem Graph bleiben können. Anhand dieser Reihenfolge werden dann nach und nach die Kanten der Quellen, die wahrscheinlich kein neues FAS erzeugen, dem azyklischen Graphen <b>alG</b> wieder hinzugefügt. Dem gegenüber wird dann der Versuch von einer zufälligen, nicht nach Quellen orientierten Neuaufnahme von Kanten gegenüber gestellt und beide Versuche werden dann miteinander verglichen."

Instead, however, we were able to add single edges that, while coming from the critical source area, were randomly added and not by the criterion of a specific source. This does prove that the algorithm of <b>Eades</b> to induce a MFAS isn't the minimal solution for the FAS-problem. Although we did not achieve our goal of reducing the number of sources within the FAS, we were able to add random edges of the FAS back to the <b> alG </b> graph without sacrificing performance or creating new cycles."
