    "In this notebook we take a detailed look at the macrogenesis of the <b>Faust</b> edition. As explained in the Readme (see: <i>Readme.md</i>), the manuscripts hold the problem that a ordering of all these manuscript by dates isn't possible. One of the reasons are the contradictory datings. These are due to the fact that the inclusion of the various research opinions induces different datings. The goal of the macrogenesis is to create an order with a <b>graph</b> as structure.<br> A graph can be sorted topologically and thus realize the goal of the ordered macrogenesis. To create a topological order the graph has to be acyclic. Due to the contradictions, however, it is not acyclic. To obtain an acyclic graph, edges must be removed. The removed set of edges to make a graph acyclic is called <b>FAS</b> (= Feedback Arc Set or Feedback Edge Set). The algorithm we will use to compute a minimal FAS (MFAS) is by Peter <b>Eades</b> because it is simple, effective and doesn't need a lot of computing power.<br><br>\n",
    "In this notebook we will rely on the following three main questions:\n",
    "1. How can we integrate the absolute datings? How does the FAS look like with and without absolute datings?\n",
    "2. Can a more detailed analysis of the number of edges and the number of contradictions be helpful to decide which edges of which source should be removed?\n",
    "3. Can erroneously removed edges be re-added without sacrificing performance? How can this be done and how many edges can be re-added?\n",

    "<b>Section 2 &amp; 3</b>: In this sections we generate the graph out of two different graphs. In section 3.1 we generate graphs based on the @temppre-relation-elements. In section 3.2 we combine the temppre-graph with a generated graph based on the date-elements. Unlike the temppre-graph, there are several variants of the date-graph, which is due to the different approaches how to implement the absolute dates. We partly answer the first main question how the integration of the absolute datings look like by comparing the different approaches and choosing the best performing approach for the integration into the graph(?). A deeper and more detailed comparison of the approaches will appear in <b>section TODO </b>(?).<br>\n",

    "In this chapter we take a look at the source attributes of the edges. In the XML files, a dating is attested by a source. The problem is that these sources contradict each other which is certainly the reason for the existance of the FAS. To make the graph acyclic, we have to get rid of these contradictory statements.<br>\n",
    "We parse through the \"source\"-attributes of the edges of the graph and return a Counter with a frequency score assigned to each researcher. The idea behind this is that a researcher who contributed more than others will get a much higher score. The problem is that by this method quantity surpasses quality. It is not that simple to compare two academic works by its quality and the resulting benefit for the research because the comparison possibilities are manifold and a detailed comparison would exceed this work. As simplification we adjust the scores by multiplying each score with a normalized year of the publication of the researchers work about <b>Faust</b>.\n",

I, Bd. 15,2, Weimar 1888\" (wa_I_15_2) and \"Fischer-Lamberg 1955\", she is the most named source for datings. \n",

    "After the normalization Bohnenkamp surpasses the \"wa_I_15_2\" and \"Fischer-Lamberg 1955\" (see the source DataFrame <i>source_df</i>). We simply assume in this work that datings of newer works are better and more accurately than older works. One of the reasonings behind this is that newer works are able to make their statements against the background of older researchs, while the older researchs are unable to do so. The normalized score will be used in the next section."

    "After the normalization of the source counts we have to take a deeper look at the <b>Feedback Arc Set</b>. The FAS contains 120 edges. More than a third of the FAS is taken up by \"wa_I_15_2\" and more than twice as much as the second, third and fourth most common sources by \"fischer-lamberg1955\", \"bohnenkamp1994\" and \"landeck1981\" (see the FAS-frequency DataFrame <i>fasfrequency_df</i>).<br> In this section we try to bypass the computed FAS by trying to make the graph <b>G</b> acylic with the removal of specific sources. We rely on the normed research score of the previous section (see 4.1). The idea behind this is that the FAS has a certain randomness because it tries to compute a minimal solution for the problem (at least if we use the <b>Eades</b> or any other MFAS algorithm). This holds the problem that the removal of the edges to make the graph <b>G</b> acyclic and its randomness makes little sense with regards of content. Against the background of an ideal solution which returns a perfect sorting, the goal is rather to find critical, conflicting sources. Nevertheless, we use the FAS to filter for critical sources and take a closer look a the sources who have the most edges within the FAS.\n",

This is not particularly surprising for the Paulus-approaches, as these are basically the Vitt approach when they are jointed (???). The problem with the Wissenbach approach seems to be that, like the Paulus-approaches, it connects only one node that represents the middle of the \"notBefore\" and \"notAfter\" dates to the manuscript. So it seems that the <b>basic structure</b> of the Vitt approach of representing \"notBefore\" and \"notAfter\" as their own nodes and linking them to the manuscript is the most practical solution. In the following we will manipulate the \"notBefore\" and the \"notAfter\" dates in the Vitt approach and see how these changes affect the nodes, edges, cycles and the FAS.\n",
